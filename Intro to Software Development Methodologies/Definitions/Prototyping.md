**Principles**
- About creating incomplete versions of the software being developed
- Basics are:
	- Not standalone, complete development methodology; rather an approach to try particular features in context of a full methodology
	- Attempts to reduce inherent risk to project by dividing it into smaller segments and ease-of-change during the development process
	- Client is involved during the development process; likelihood of acceptance increases of final iteration
	- Possible some cases to evolve from prototype to working
**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Users are active in development
- Working model of system is provided; user get experience with system being developed
- Errors can be caught earlier
- Quicker feedback is available; leads to better solutions
- Missing functionality can be found easily
- Confusing/difficult functions can be identified

**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Leads to implementing, repairing way of building systems
- Could increase the complexity of system as scope may expand beyond original plans
- Incomplete application may cause app not to be used as the fully system was designed

**When to use**
- When desired system needs to have many interactions with end users
- Online systems, web interfaces have high amount of interaction. Could take a while for system to be built that allows easy use and end user to not be trained
- Ensures end users constantly work with system and provide feedback which is then implemented in the prototype to result in a useable system
- Great for good human computer interface systems
