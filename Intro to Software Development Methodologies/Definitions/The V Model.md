**Principles**
- Means to be a testing improvement of waterfall model
- Every stage, test plans and cases are created to verify product at current stage
- Verification and Validation go in parallel

**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Simple & Easy to use
- Testing activities (planning, test designing) happen before coding; saves time
- Proactive defect tracking; defects found early
- Avoids downward flow of defects
- Works well for small projects where requirements are easily understood


**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Rigid and least flexible
- Software is developed in implementation phase; no early prototypes are produced
- Any changes midway, test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated

**When to use**
- Small - Medium sized projects where requirements are clearly defined and fixed
- When ample technical resources are available with needed technical expertise
- High confidence of customer is needed for choosing this model

- No prototypes are produced; thus high risk in meeting customers expectations
