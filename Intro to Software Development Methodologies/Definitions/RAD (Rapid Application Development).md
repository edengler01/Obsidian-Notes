**Principles**
- Favors iterative development & rapid construction of prototypes
- As opposed to construction of prototypes
- Fast development & delivery of a high quality system at a relatively low invest cost
- Attempts reduction in project risk by breaking into smaller segments & gives ease-of-change during development
- Produce systems quickly through iterative prototyping, active user involvement, and computerized development tools
- Emphasis on fulfilling business need; tech or engineering excellence is lesser importance
- Project control involves focusing on dev and defining delivery deadlines or timeboxes
- If project starts to slip, requirments are reduced to fit timebox; not pushing deadline back

- Includes Joint Application Design

- Where users are intensely involved in system design via consensus building in either workshops or electronically facillated interaction

- Active user involvement is imperative
- Iteratively produces production software, as opposed to throwaway prototype
- Produces documentation necessary to facilitate future development and mainteance
- Standard systems analysis and design methods can be fitting into this framework

**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Reduced development time
- Increases reusability of components
- Quick initial reviews occur
- Encourages customer feedback
- Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues

**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Depends on strong team & individual performances for identifying business requirements
- Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD
- Requires highly skilled developers/designers
- High dependency on modeling skills
- Inapplicable to cheaper projects as cost of model and automated code generation is very high

**When to use**
- When you need to make a modular system in 2-3months time
- Should be used if high availability of designers for modeling
- Budget high enough to afford their cost along with cost of automated code generating tools
- Its SDLC should be chosen only if resources with high business knowledge are available and there is a need to produce the system in a short span of time
