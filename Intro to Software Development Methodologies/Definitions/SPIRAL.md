- Good for large or mission-critical projects
- Strong approval and documentation control
- Additional functionality can be added at a later date
- Additional functionality can be added at a later date
- Software is produced early in the life cycle

**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Can be a costly model to use
- Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise
- Project's success highly dependent on risk analysis phase
- Doesn't work well for smaller projects
**When to use**
- When costs & risk evaluation is key
- Medium to high risk projects
- Long term commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities
- Users are unsure of their needs
- Requirements are complex
- New product line
- Significant changes are expected (research and exploration
