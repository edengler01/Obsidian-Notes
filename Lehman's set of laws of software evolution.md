- Laws describe a balance between forces driving new developments on one hand
	- and forces that slow down progress on the other hand


Three Categories of Software
- [[S-type program]]
- [[P-type program]]
- [[E-type program]]

[[Seven laws of Software Evolution]]
1. Continuing Change
	- [[E-type program]]s must be continually adapted, or the become less useful over time
2. Increasing Complexity
	- As an [[E-type program]] evolves, its complexity increases, unless it is maintained or attempts to reduce it
3. Self Regulation
	- Evolution process of [[E-type program]]s is self regulating
		- Time distribution of measures of process & products
4. Conservation of Organisational Stability: Average effective global activity rate in an evolving [[E-type program]] is invariant over the product's lifetime
5. Conservation of Familiarity
	- Average content of successive release is constant during the life-cycle of an evolving [[E-type program]]
6. Continuing Growth
	- Maintain user satisfaction with program over its lifetime, functional content must be continually increased
7. Declining Quality
	   - Perceived by its stakeholders to have declining quality if it is not maintained & adapted to its environment
