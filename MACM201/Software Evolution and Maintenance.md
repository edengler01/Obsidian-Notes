## Change in Software is Inevitable
- Software doesn't wear out like physical artifacts
	- Corrective maintenance: fixed
	- Adaptive maintenance: adapt to changing needs
	- Perfective maintenance: performance/maintainability improved
	- Preventive maintenance: fix bugs before they activate
- If these measure are not taken, software becomes a legacy system
	- Hard to evolve and maintain
- Lehman proposed a set of laws for software evolution
	- Three R's support these operations proposed


## Three R's of Software Evolution
- Reverse engineering: Analyze system (e.g to create accurate documentation)
- Refactoring: Clean up code without changing its functionality
- Reengineering: Create a maintainable system out of an unmaintainable one (larger scale than refactoring)
Typical claim: more resources are spent on these activities than on new development
Derived from Three R's of Hard Sciences
- Reductionism
- Repeatability
- Refutation

## Principles, Guidelines and Standards
- Principles
	- abstract design rules ("an interface should be easy to navigate")
- guidelines
	- advice on how to achieve principle
	- may conflict; understanding theory helps resolve
- standards
	- specific rules, measurable
Note: a legacy system is difficult to evolve
- Always difficult to make changes with out disrupting existing users
- Systems obsolete as soon as they are shipped
