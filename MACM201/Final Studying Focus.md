[[Lecture 25 & 26 Planarity]]
[[Lecture 24 Eulerian Circuits & Trails]]
[[Lecture 23 Multigraphs]]

### Concepts
- Chapter 6 Summary
	- Walks: How we move in a graph. A sequence of vertex and edges
	- Subgraphs: Subset of vertices & edges that form a graph within the larger graph
	- Degree: Number of edges incident with that vertex
		- The sum of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edge
	- Eulerian
		- Trail: Every edge is visited
		- Circuit (cycle): Every edge is visited & ends at the vertex the walk started at
		
	- Planar Graphs: A graph that can be drawn on the plane with no edges intersecting with each other
		- If K<sub>5</sub> or K<sub>3,3</sub> are present in the subgraph the graph is not planar
			- Take into account the sub divisions.
	- Hamilton Path & Cycle: a path or a cycle that visits a vertex at least one.
		- If there is enough edges, then it admits there is a Hamilton Path/Cycle
		- One proof admits to a path for all pairs of vertices *x,y, deg(x)+deg(y)>= n-1*
