 #### How to check
 - The graph contains exactly 2 vertices of odd degree
 
### Euler Circuit
- Every edge appears exactly once
- The start & end vertex are the same

 #### How to check
 - Every vertex is vertex is even degree



### Hamilton Path
- A simple walk where every vertex is visited once


### Hamilton Cycle
- Each vertex is visited once
- The walk starts and ends at the same vertex  ![[Pasted image 20231202014250.png]]
