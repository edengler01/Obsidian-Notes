### Theorem 6.4.1
- If G is a graph with a [[Hamilton Cycle]], then G - v (Graph G minus a vertex) is connected for every vertex in V
	- A Hamilton Cycle implies that G minus a vertex (G - v) is connected


### Theorem 6.4.2
- Let G be a bipartite graph with bipartition *V = V<sub>1</sub> U V<sub>2</sub>*. If G has a Hamiltonian cycle, then *|V1| - |V<sub>2</sub>|*
-  A [[Hamilton Cycle]] has the form: v<sub>1</sub> - w<sub>1</sub>- v<sub>2</sub>-w<sub>w</sub> ...... -v<sub>k</sub>-w<sub>k</sub> -v<sub>1</sub>
	- These happen in pairs
	- So |V<sub>1</sub>| = k = |V<sub>2</sub>|
