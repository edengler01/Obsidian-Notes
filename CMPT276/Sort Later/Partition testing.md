- Identifying groups of inputs that have common characteristics & should be processed in the same way
	- Should choose tests from within each of the groups
- I/O results often fall into different classes where all members of a class are related
- Each classes is an [[equivalence partition]] or domain where the program behaves in an equivalent way for each class member
- Test cases should be chosen from each partition
