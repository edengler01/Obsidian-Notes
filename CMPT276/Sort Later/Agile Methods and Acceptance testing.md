- Agile: user/customer is part of the dev team
	- Responsible for making decisions on acceptability of the system
- Tests are defined by customer
	- then integrated with other tests so the run automatically when changes are made
- No separate acceptance testing process
- Main problem
	- Is the embedded user "typical" 
	- Can represent the interests of all system stakeholders
