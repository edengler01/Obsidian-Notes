- Exhaustive testing is impossible
	- So policies which define the required system test coverage may be developed


Example:
- All system functions that are accessed through menus should be tested
- Combinations of functions (e.g text formatting) that are accessed through the same menu must be tested
- User input is provided, all functions must be tested with both correct & incorrect input
