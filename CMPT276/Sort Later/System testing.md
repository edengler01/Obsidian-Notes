- Some or all components in a system are integrated and the system is tested as a whole
- Should focus on testing components interactions


- involves testing during the development process
	- integrating components to create a version of the system and then testing said integrated system
	- Focus: test interactions between components
	- Checks if they are compatible, interact correctly, transfer the right data at the right time across their interfaces
	- System testing test the emergent behavior of a system
