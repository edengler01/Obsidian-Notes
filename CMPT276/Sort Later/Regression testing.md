- Testing the system to check that changes have not "broken" previously working code
	- Manual testing: expensive
	- Automated testing: simple & straight forward
		- All tests are rerun every time a change is made to the program
- Test must successful before the change is commited
- Test suite is developed incrementally as a program is developed
