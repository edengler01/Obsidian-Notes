**The Fundamental Engineering Tool**
- Computer-aided Design software
- Used for detailed engineering of 3D/2D models/drawings of physical components


**The SWE Tool - CASE**
- Stands for Computer Aided Software Engineering
- Helps develop and maintain software projects with the help of various automated software tools
- An attempt of SWE trying to be as "Engineer-like" as possible
- Some tools help with 
	- Dev of graphical system models
	- Generation of code from these graphical models
	- Generation of user interfaces from a graphical interface description that is created by the user
	- Program debugging through the provision of info about an executing program
	- Automated translation of programs written using an old version of a language to a more recent version


**What is UML**
- A pictorial language
- Used for modeling

**Basic Idea for UML**
- Need a universal language
- See the bigger picture


**Design**
- Helps visualize
	- activities
	- individual components
	- how the system will run
	- how entities interact with others
	- external user interface

**Modeling**
- UML represent two different views of a system model:
	- [[Static View]]
	- [[Dynamic view]]

**Types of Diagrams**
- [[Structure Diagrams]]
- [[Behavior Diagrams]]
- [[Interaction Diagrams]]


**Criticisms**
- Common ones:
	- [[not useful]]
	- [[too complex]]
	- need to keep UML & code in sync, as with documentation generally
