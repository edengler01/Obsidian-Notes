### Types of Requirements
- [[User Requirements]]
- [[System Requirements]]

### Example:
[[User Requirements]]

[[System Requirements]]
- The system needs to be able to spell check documents and provide autocorrect facilities. Their will be support for the following languages, English, French and German will plug in for other languages

- [[Requirements Engineering]]

#### Requirements Engineering Process
##### Typical problems in the Requirement Phase
- Requirements do not accurately account for customer's real problems
- Not Properly prioritized
- Stated at an inappropriate level of specification
	- Over-specification: embeds unnecessary design constraints
	- Under-specification: missing or incomplete definition of requirements 


### Non-Agile Process
Four steps
- [[Feasibility Study]]
- [[Requirement Gathering]]
- [[Software Req Specification]]
- [[Software Req Validation]]
