# 1. What is computer software?
- Set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks

# 2. The difference between computer software and computer programs
- Program: Piece of code/set of instructions that performs a given task
- Software: Set of programs used to perform a task (more complex)


# 3. What is software engineering 
- The process involving distinct phases in creating projects

# 4. When you know programming, what is the need to learn software engineering concepts?
- SWE concepts gives a programmer a path(s) on how they can proceed with their software/project
- A programmer could just start programming their project without any communication or requirements but they could run in to problems relating to things like requirements, constraints, etc


# 5. What is software process or Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- The process where software is built efficiently and effectively
- Many Phases
	1. Requirement Analysis
	2. Planning
	3. Design
	4. Build
	5. Test
	6. Deployment/Maintenance

# 6. What SDLC models available? 
- Models that were covered in class
1. Waterfall
2. Prototyping
3. Iterative & Incremental Development
4. Reuse-oriented software engineering
5. V Model
6. SPIRAL
7. RAD



# 7. What are the various phases of the SDLC?
- Some universal phases in SDLC are:
	- Requirement research
	- Analysis of the model
	- Design Analysis: How every part of the system might play out
	- Testing: Could be during the coding phase (unit testing) or done at the very end



# 8. Which SDLC model is best?
- There is no silver bullet
- Each have their uses
- Waterfall 
	- When the project has clear objectives/solutions
	- Large and complicated
	- Requirements are static
	- Formal approval for requirement changes
-  Prototyping
	- User are active in development
	- When the end product has many interactions with end users
	- Online systems
	- Mostly for Human Computer Interface Systems
-  Iterative & Incremental Development
	- Changing requirements cost is reduced
	- Easier to get feedback on increments
	- Rapid deployment of useful software even if functionality is not there
- Reuse-oriented software engineering
	- Useful for projects that are open-source, relies on functionality that are already out there but need to be fine tuned for specific need
-  V Model
	- Useful for testing/risk analysis before coding; saves time
	- Proactive in detecting defects
	- Works well for smaller projects
- SPIRAL
	- Large amount of risk analysis
	- Good for mission critical projects
	- Strong approval and documentation control
	- Additional functionality can be added later
	- Software is produced early one
-  RAD
	- Reduced development time
	- Increase reusability of componets
	- Encourages customer feedback
	- Integration from the start solves a lot of integration issues
- AGILE
	- Rapid delivery of software
	- Works well in an environment with everchanging requirements


# 9 What is software project managment? 

# 10. Who is software project manager?

# 11 What does the project manager do?



What would help make SWE a true branch of engineering?
- Possibly make the field more empirically based\

Which is not one of the reasons for the so-called S/W crisis
- S/W Crisis: Software dev projects are over-budger, behind schedule
	- Then the software prodcued is often unreliable and unusuable
	- Mostly due to people failures outweigh the technical failures
- Reason that is not part of the crisis: None of them
