1. Reverse engineering: Analyze existing system to create accurate documentation
2. Refactoring: Clean up code without modifying functionality
3. Reengineering: Creating a maintainable system out of an unmaintainable one (at a larger scale than refactoring)


Typical claim: more resources are spent on these activities than on new development
