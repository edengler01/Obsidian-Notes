**What do we mean by largest programs?**
- Source Lines of Code?
- Large in terms of complexity?
- Large in terms of time and effort and number of people involved?
- Large in terms of cost?

**Prelim Analysis**
- Seems SW paradigm focuses more on productivity rather than engineering (technical) metrics


**Two Dimensions for Any Large-Scale Project**
- ![[Pasted image 20231009222334.png]]
- Failure
	1. Administrative
	2. Technical (malfunctions)

**Ten reasons for S/W Bugs**
1. Miscommunication or no communication
2. Software complexity
3. Programming Errors
4. Changing Requirements
5. Time Pressures
6. Egotistical or overconfident people
7. Poorly documented code
8. Software development tools
9. Obsolete automation scripts
10. Lack of skilled testers


**Rise of Software Engineering**
- Software has become complex
- Modest programs do not scale well
- Pace of change in computer and software tech drives demand
- Availability of qualified software engineers has not kept pace
- Led to a so called Software Crisis

**Definition: Algorithm**
- Well-ordered collection of well defined and effectively computable operations that, when executed, produces a result and solves a problem within a finite amount of time

**What is software?**
- All information processed by computer systems, programs and data

**What exactly is engineering?**
1. The design & manufacture of complex products
- Making ENGINES
- Software is abstract & invisible 
	- Both static & dynamic properties
- No standard of quality exists
- Manufacturing cycle not main part of dev
	- Dev is essentially a process that involves a progression through many layers of design abstraction
		- hence unlike any conventional engineering processes
- Software does not wear out


**Hardware vs Software**

**The Ambiguity of "Software Engineering"**
- Based on logical work
	- While traditional is based on physical work
- Progress is largely invisible
	- Can't see the outcome in the middle of the project
- Complexity of software project is difficult to gauge in early stages
	- Work needs to happen even grasp it
- High level of uncertainty due to difficulty to accurately define requirements for software projects at the start of development

**Two Dimensions for Software Engineering**
- Managing relevant process with design activities
	- management vs technical dimension
- Team-based
- Layers of complication
	- Teams must be organized in communication, coordination, management
- Many different measures of quality can be employed when project is "done"

**What an engineering education can prepare you for**
1. How to learn
2. A starting point
3. Teach you to work with others
4. Provide technical skills
**It does not teach:**
1. Communication
2. Real-world experience
3. Account for changes in technology
