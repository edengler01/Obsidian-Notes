- models are principlal
	- instead of programs
- prgrams execute on platform are generated auto from models
- Argue that this raise level of abstraction
	- don't have to learn programing language or specifics of execution platforms




**Usage**
- Pros
	- systems are considered at higher level of abstraction
	- generating code auto means that its cheaper to adapt to new platforms
- Cons
	- models for abstraction not necessarily right for implementation
	- savings from generating code may be outweighed by the costs of developing translators
	-
