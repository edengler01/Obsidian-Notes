**Principles**
- Good chunk of projects have some software reuse
- Look for these, modify them as needed and corporate them into their system
- Stages:
	1. Component analysis: Given requirements, components are searched for; usually no exact match so provide only partial functionality
	2. Requirements modification: Components are analyzed, then modified to reflect available components; Where modifications are impossible analysis activity may be re started to search for alternative solutions
	3. System design with reuse: Framework of system designed/existing framework is reused; components that are reused and organze the framework are catered; some new software may have be designed if resuable components are not available
	4. Development & integration: Software that cannot be externally procurred is developed, and components and COTS systems are intergrated to create the new system
