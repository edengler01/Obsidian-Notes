**Principles**
- Combination of both iterative design or methods and incremental build model
- Essential parts of modified waterfall models
- Incremental development

- Primary objective: reduce project risk by breaking it into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the process
- Three main variants

1. Series of mini-Waterfalls are performed, all Waterfalls are completed for portion of system before moving to next increment
2. Overall requirements are defined before evolving, mini-Waterfall development of individual increments of a system
3. Initial software concept, requirements analysis, design of architecture and system core are defined via Waterfall, followed by incremental implementation, which culiminates in installing final, working version

**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Three benefits compared to Waterfall
	1. Cost of changing customer requirements reduced. Redoing documentation & analysis less than waterfall method
	2. Easier to get customer feedback on dev work; customers find it hard to judge progress from just documents
	3. More rapid delivery & deployment of useful software to the customer possible, even if all it does not work; Customers able to use & gain value from software earlier than possible from waterfall

**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Primary cause of difficulty: large organization wrapped up in business red tape that evolved over time; may be a mismatch between procedure & more informal iterative or agile process
- Agile: aims at creating a "potentially shippable product"
