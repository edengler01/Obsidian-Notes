**Principles**
1. System & Software Requirements: Captured in requirements documentation
2. Analysis: models, schema and business rules
3. Design: Software architecture is the result
4. Coding: Development, proving and integration of software
5. Testing: Structured discovery & debugging of defects
6. Operations: installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems
- A more realistic model is the Waterfall Model with "iterative feedback loops"
	- Where after each step, you go back and check



**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Project has clear objectives & solutions
- Large and complicated
- Requirements are unchanging
- Required for formal approvals at designated milestones


**Disadvantages/Leas Appropriate***
