**Principles**
- Uses iterative development as a basis
- But advocates a lighter and more people-centric viewpoint
- Incorporate iteration and continous feedbacl that it provides to refine a software system

**Advantages/Most Appropriate**
- Rapid delivery of useful software brings customer satisfaction
- People & interactions are emphasized instead of process and tools
- Customers, devs and testers constantly interact with eachother
- Working software is delivered frequently
- Face-to-face conversation best way to communicate
- Close cooperation with business and dev
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- Regular adaptation to changing circumstances
- Late changes in requirements are welcomed

**Disadvantages/Least Appropriate**
- Some deliverables (large ones) are difficult to asses the effort required at the start of the SDLC
- Lack of emphasis on necessary desinging and documentation
- Project can easily get off track id custom rep is not clear what final outcome they want
- Only senior programmers are able at taking kind of decisions during dev process

- Hence no plan for newbie programmers, unless combined with exprienced resources

**When to use**
- New changes are need to be implemented
- Cost little due to frequent new increments that are produced
- Implement a new feature the dev need to lose only the work of a few days, or hours to roll back and implement
- Unlike waterfall, limited planning is required
- Assumes end users' needs are ever changing

- Both devs and stakeholder alike find they get more freedom of time and options than if software was developed in a more rigid sequential way
