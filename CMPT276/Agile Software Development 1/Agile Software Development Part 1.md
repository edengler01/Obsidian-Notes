### Basic Idea
- Rapid development & delivery now [[important requirement]]
- Older [[Plan-driven development]] models too slow/rigid
- Emerged in the late 90s
- Tries to radically reduce time spent on deliverables
#### Characteristics
- Program specs, design and implementation are **inter-leaved**
- System developed **incrementally** with stakeholders **involved**
- Extensive tool support (automated testing tools) used to support development
- Minimal documentations - focus on working code

### Four Agile Values
1. [[Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools]]
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Self-organization and motivation are key. Interactions like co-location and pair programming.</span>
2. [[Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation]]
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Working software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.</span>
3. [[Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation]]
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Requirements cannot be fully collected at the start of the SDLC. Continuous customer/stakeholder involvement is very important.</span>
4. [[Responding to Change Over Following a Plan]]
	- <span style="color:#ffc000">Agile methods focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.</span>

## Agile Development Techniques
- [[Extreme programming - XP]]
- [[Extreme programming - XP]] & Agile
	- Incremental development is supported through small, frequent system releases
	- Customer is involved with these small release
	- Community like processes help flesh out problems
	- Maintains simplicity through constant refactoring of code
### Refactoring
- Changes can be easier to make because code is well-structured
- Helps improve understandability of software
	- Reduces the need of documentation
		- Example: Making functions clear enough that their name is all that is needed to describe/document them.

### Test-First
[[Test-First Development]]
[[Test-Driven Development]]
[[Customer Involvement (in Test Development)]]
[[Test Automation]]
#### Problems
- Programmers prefer to actually program the software, instead of writing the tests
- Some times take shortcuts when writing tests
- Some tests can be hard to write incrementally
- Difficult to judge the completeness of a set of tests
	- Even if you have many system tests, may not completely cover everything


### Pair Programming
- Programmers sit beside each other at the same computer
- One drives, the other navigates
- Sharing of knowledge is vital


____ 
## Criticisms of Agile Development
- Developer-centric
	- Instead of user-centric
- Focuses on processes for getting requirements
	- But not on the product design
- Agile methodologies can be inefficient in large organizations and projects
