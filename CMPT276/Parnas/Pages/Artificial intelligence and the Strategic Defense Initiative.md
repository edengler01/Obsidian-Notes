**Introduction**
AI cannot help the development of the SDI much.

**What is AI**
1. [[AI-1]]
2. [[AI-2]]

Possible for a program to meet one definition but not the other. Workers in [[AI-1]] often use traditional engineering & scientific methods. They study the problem, physical and logical constraints and then write a program the follows the same way most people would solve that problem.

**What can we learn from AI that will help us build the battle-management computer software?**
- Some good work in [[AI-1]] but nothing magical
- [[AI-2]] disappointing. Heuristics only worked in obvious cases but failed in general cases
- Techniques do not generalize and improved programs never seem to appear
**What about expert systems?**
- Seems to be a nightmare to maintain
	- poorly understood, structured and thus hard to maintain
- Some problems in SDI are in a realm where there are no human experts
	- Humans can't reliably look at missiles in ballistic flight and distinguish which is a decoy and which is the real one

**Conclusion**
- AI and Intelligence are alike from a broad point of view
	- closer look reveals they are different
- AI offers no silver bullet to solve the problems
- Heuristics are not trustable
