**Intro**
- Some felt that the research into this might spawn some good modules


**Moral Issue**
- Is it moral to take the money of taxpayers for something that MIGHT spawn something good?

**Is the DoD sponsoring of software research effective**
- Is this a good way to get research done?
- Wanton research projects that lead nowhere
	- but millions of dollars spent
- DoD is ineffective because the bureaucrats who run it do not understand what they are buying


**Who can judge research?**
- Crucial step is identifying the problem
- Applied research needs teams of people of various backgrounds 

**Who judges research into DoD?**
- Those that approve of applied research aren't the greatest
	- The best are working in the labs, not funding agencies
- [[Technocrats]] usually are the ones who approve of research

**The SDIO**
- typical organization filled with technocrats
- has no one with experience with battle management software


**Conclusion**
- No justification for continuing research just to obtain funding in an attempt to get a worthwhile module out of it
