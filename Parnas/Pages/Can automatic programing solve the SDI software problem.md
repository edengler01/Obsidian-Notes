**Perspective**
- Automatic programming is just a guise for programming in a higher-level
- Research in automated programming is just research in to higher level programming languages

**Is it feasible?**
- The real question is efficiency
- If the spec is not a description of an algorithm
	- resulting program is inefficient
- When the input spec is a description of algorithm, its really just writing a program

**Could it lead to more reliable programs?**
- Helped programmers have to remember less
	- Nothing will change if we keep using an algorithmic approach
- Writing non-algorithmic specs have shown that people make mistakes in writing them
	- Just as they do when writing algorithmic specs

**Could it lead to reliable SDI battle-management?**
- Auto programming that differs from the way humans do is not likely to become practical for real time systems
- Basic problem in SDI: Do not trust the information to write specifications
	- Tactics could change irregularly
